This script deals with a problem known as the mouse or beetle problem. A description can be found on the web site:

In the general problem, n mice start at the corners of a regular n-gon. Each mouse travels towards its closest neighbor (in a counterclockwise direction) at a constant speed. The paths that the mice take form spiral curves. An animation of the pattern can be seen on the above web site.
